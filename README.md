# com.adobe.Reader

This is a work-in-progress Flatpak of Acrobat Reader 9.5.5 for Linux

I really which this would just work, but it's broken and produces a `Bad system call` error. If you can help me figure it out, I would be immensely grateful. 

```bash
flatpak run --command=bash --devel com.adobe.Reader
```

```
